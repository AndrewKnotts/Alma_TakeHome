# Lead Manager â€” Take-Home

A minimal Next.js app that provides:
- Public lead form with validation and file upload
- Internal leads list behind mock auth
- API routes and in-memory DB for create/list/update
- Details page to display all submitted info (while table matches the mock)

## Run locally

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
